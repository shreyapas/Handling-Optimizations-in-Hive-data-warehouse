HANDLING OPTIMIZATIONS USING VIEW CONCEPT ON HIVE DATA WAREHOUSE :

Apache Hive uses batch processing to examine enormous amounts of data. Apache Hive and the HDFS file system provide a fault-tolerant system for Big Data analysis. It also uses HiveQL, a structured query language similar to SQL, to communicate with large databases.
This project is mainly focusing on optimizations using views concept on hive data warehouse in real time scenarios. Here we taken stocks data and processed some essential queries to demonstrate handling low latency
